# donation-primitive

## Description

This project aims to create a novel charity donation platform, inspired by Polymarket and Farcaster, that allows users to bet on environmental impacts and allocate donations more effectively to areas in need. 

### Rootstock Integration

We created the smart contract in Solidity. Because Rootstock is EVM compatible, deploying the smart contract to Rootstock was simple. We utilized Remix to develop the smart contract, which made it easy to test the contract within its own Remix VM. Afterwards, we used MetaMask to inject the provider, and deployed to Rootstock.
