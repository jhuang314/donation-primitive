# donation-primitive

## Description

This project aims to create a novel charity donation platform, inspired by Polymarket and Farcaster, that allows users to bet on environmental impacts and allocate donations more effectively to areas in need. 

### Rootstock Integration

Our Solidity smart contract was seamlessly deployed to Rootstock due to its EVM compatibility. Using Remix for development and testing, we efficiently iterated and verified its functionality. Finally, we deployed to Rootstock through MetaMask, leveraging its provider integration
