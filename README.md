# donation-primitive

## Description

This project aims to create a novel charity donation platform, inspired by Polymarket and Farcaster, that allows users to bet on environmental impacts and allocate donations more effectively to areas in need. 

### Rootstock Integration

Our Solidity smart contract was seamlessly deployed to Rootstock due to its EVM compatibility. Using Remix for development and testing, we efficiently iterated and verified its functionality. Finally, we deployed to Rootstock through MetaMask, leveraging its provider integration

### The team

### Testing the integration.

Use Remix! 

1. git clone this repo using Remix
1. compile the bet_flattened.sol
1. go to "Deploy & Run" in Remix, select MetaMask injected provider.
1. deploy the bet_flattened.sol contract
1. either use Rootstock explorer or Remix to interact with the contract.

### Frontend

[The frontend that utilizes Farcaster frames is in a separate Git repo](https://github.com/fourcolors/climabets)


### Feedback about the experience
The experience of integrating our project with Rootstock was truly exceptional. The seamless deployment process and the ease of use of Remix for development and testing made it a pleasure to work with. The MetaMask integration also provided a smooth and secure way to interact with the contract. Overall, it was a great experience that allowed us to efficiently test and verify the functionality of our project.

### demo

We're excited to share that our demo is now live! You can test it out and experience the platform firsthand. Stay tuned for the integration of production oracle data, coming soon. Thanks for your interest!
